brainTrust (improve coding skills, learn git and github)
==========

Are you a newbie to the world of github?
Know html, css, and some JavaScript and want to make a contribution to a git hub project?

**Welcome!** This is the hub for you. I find the learning curve to be very steep for using github. After reading many tutorials and watching many videos, I feel I am only slightly above newbie status with using github.

**Git and Github in Plain English**

Yes! There is a difference between Git and GitHub
This brainTrust repository is for developing a basic informational Website about git and github using basic coding: HTML, CSS, and javascript, while providing a hub for learning to use git and pull requests to add and edit pages and fix real and practice issues. 

**BrainTrust Website**

The site will have simple pages, including FAQ's and reviews for videos and Web sites to learn about Github and the basic coding used to develop the site.

**Contributions are Welcome!**

Contributions are welcome, but please be advised this is a one-person operation and, as such, responses may not be as fast as you would like. 

Unlike many sites you don't have to download an overwhelming amount of frameworks and other things to get started. All you need is a text editor. I reccommend notepad++ (simple to use, but more useful than Windows notepad). You will need to download github to your local machine, unless you choose to edit files using the edit link on the github site.

That's all for now. I hope to start building the site soon. Hopefully, if I build it, githubbers will come.
